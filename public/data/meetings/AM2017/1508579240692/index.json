He received PhD from IISc in 1992 and has held visiting/adjunct positions at Cardiff, Tokyo, TASC-INFM, Trieste; Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa; Purdue, etc. His research interests are focused on new strategies in the synthesis of nanomaterials, nanopatterning and nanode-vice fabrication including of molecular systems. His group strives to translate nanoresearch findings into affordable technologies. Apart from over 265 research articles and several na-tional and international patents, Kulkarni has contributed to 13 books and coauthored a book, <i>Nanocrystals</i>. He has to his credit, Sir C. V. Raman Young Scientist award, the MRSI-ICSC Superconductivity and Materials Science Annual Prize and Bangalore Nano National Award, among others. He is a Fellow of NASI, Indian Academy of Sciences (2014) and Asia Pacific Academy of Materials."

        "title": "From mud cracks to optoelectronic devices â€“ our efforts in translating invention to technology",
        "abstract": "Visibly transparent, yet electrically conducting materials, are rare. Conventionally used tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) glass plates are not only expensive but are also not suitable for flexible displays due to brittle nature of the coating itself. In recent years, many alternative transparent conductors are being developed, some important ones being doped ZnO and conducting polymer films, graphene, carbon nanotube networks, metal nanowire networks and lithographic patterns. In the recent past, a method that makes use of crack network in desiccated colloidal layer as a template for growing metal nanowires has been developed. From early efforts of optimising the method to fabricating and successfully demonstrating almost all optoelectronic devices without the aid of ITO, has been a journey filled with excitement and challenges. The recipe has been extended to many other devices, essentially realising a world of transparent electronics; the most recent example is a transparent and flexible supercapacitor. The presentation will begin with an introduction to the topic providing an overview of the efforts being made in the literature to replace ITO, followed by a description of the various results obtained from the laboratory including a theoretical understanding of the process. The talk will also bring out efforts involved in translating this invention into a technology potentially attractive to industry."
