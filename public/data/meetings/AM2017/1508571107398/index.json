        "biodata": "Gobinda Majumder joined TIFR, in 1992, as a graduate student in experimental high energy physics, where he worked in the L3 experiment for his PhD thesis, ‘Search for supersymmetric particle in e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>–</sup> collisions at LEP’. His major contribution, however, was in the choosing of the material for the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter, its size, shape, etc. The discovery of Higgs Boson from the CMS experiment came from that subdetector. After completing his PhD, he joined Syracuse University, New York, in March 1998 for Post-Doctoral work, where he developed software codes for the CLEO-III Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector and studied the feasibility of the proposed BTeV experiment at FNAL. He returned to TIFR as a Fellow (D) in December 2000. Initially, he worked for the BELLE experiment and was involved with the discovery of new charmonium resonances; he also changed the concept of physics with missing energy measurements at asymmetric e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>–</sup> machine. He had a crucial role in the construction, calibration and installation of the CMS outer hadron calorimeter. He is contributing to the study of the Standard Model physics at CMS experiment. He has also developed the complete INO simulation and reconstruction code from scratch and is taking part in an aspect of INO. At present, he is serving as a professor at TIFR. He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2015 and National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI) in 2016."

        "title": "A journey to the discovery of Higgs Boson",
        "abstract": "The Higgs Boson was predicted in 1964 to provide masses of the carrier of electro-weak interactions; it was ascribed a range of 0–1 TeV but was not attributed with a specific mass. In the nineties, experiments at Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, Geneva, looked for the signature of Higgs Bosons and gradually ruled out Higgs with lower masses (&gt;114.4 GeV). In parallel experiments on proton–proton collision at Tevatron, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), USA also ended up with the null results. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at Geneva, was constructed mainly to look for this Boson, and within few years of operation, experiments at LHC led to the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. In this talk, various steps of this journey will be summarised."
