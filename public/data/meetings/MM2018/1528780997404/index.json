        "session": "Session 2C – Symposium on “Blockchains and Cryptocurrency”",
        "chairperson": ": R L Karandikar, CMI, Chennai",
        "title": "Introduction to blockchains",
        "abstract": "A blockchain is a list of records or blocks that grows continuously. Blockchains can be&#13;&#10;used to implement distributed ledgers that maintain a permanent and verifiable transaction&#13;&#10;history. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network with decentralized&#13;&#10;updates. Distributed consensus protocols are used to maintain coherence. Integrity against&#13;&#10;tampering is ensured through cryptography. The speaker will explain the theory and technology&#13;&#10;behind blockchains as well as the implications for applications of features such as&#13;&#10;cryptography and decentralized control."
