        "chairperson": "Anil K Gupta, IIT, Kharagpur",
        "title": "Development of fluorescent probes for molecular recognition, bioimaging, and catalytic applications",
        "abstract": "Fluorescent chemosensors have been widely explored in many diverse fields from biology&#13;&#10;and physiology to pharmacology and environmental sciences. The most explored usage&#13;&#10;of chemosensors is molecular recognition involving cation/anion sensing with applications&#13;&#10;in the development of molecular logic gates and keypad locks. With the advent of time,&#13;&#10;the applications of fluorescent probes have extended to medicine involving bio-imaging&#13;&#10;and diagnostics. The speaker will discuss the design and synthesis of an array of novel&#13;&#10;chemosensors developed by his lab. The applications of these chemosensors in diverse&#13;&#10;fields including in the detection of metal ions, logic gate based devices, detection of explosives,&#13;&#10;detection of bioanalytes in vitro and in vivo will be discussed. Furthermore, the scope&#13;&#10;of these chemosensors as a diagnostic tool by developing small molecule-based fluorescent&#13;&#10;molecules will be highlighted."
