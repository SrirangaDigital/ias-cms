        "title": "Transfer RNAs: Not merely adaptor molecules in protein synthesis",
        "abstract": "Francis Crick proposed for the first time, in an informal manuscript submitted to the RNA&#13;&#10;Tie Club in 1955, the ‘adaptor hypothesis’ which filled an important gap in the information&#13;&#10;flow from DNA to proteins. While the role of transfer RNAs as adaptor molecules dominated&#13;&#10;our thinking during most part of the last century, the post-genomic era has uncovered&#13;&#10;diverse and critical cellular roles played by them. Notable among these is the very recent&#13;&#10;identification of tRNA-derived fragments involved in sperm maturation and fertilization. In&#13;&#10;addition to these totally unexpected cellular functions, the speaker will discuss the central&#13;&#10;role played by tRNAs in maintaining translational fidelity and situations that compromise&#13;&#10;faithful translation of the genetic code. In this context, the speaker will present two aspects&#13;&#10;of his recent work that focus on tRNA gene expansion in higher eukaryotes and evolutionary&#13;&#10;selection pressures that act on the ‘discriminator code’!"

He obtained&#13;&#10;his PhD from IISc, Bengaluru (1996) and was a postdoctoral research fellow at IGBMC,&#13;&#10;Strasbourg, France (1996–2002), before joining as a research group leader at CSIR-CCMB&#13;&#10;(2002). His group works on biophysical and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanistic&#13;&#10;basis of functioning of biomolecules and has made outstanding contributions in&#13;&#10;the area of proofreading during translation of the genetic code. He is a recipient of may&#13;&#10;prestigious awards including the Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship&#13;&#10;(2003), the Swarnajayanthi Fellowship of DST (2005–2006), and the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar&#13;&#10;Award (2011). He is an elected Fellow of all the three major science academies of&#13;&#10;the country (FASc in 2010)."
