of Earth Sciences, New Delhi. His research is focused on earthquakes and their origin
in India using crustal deformation data from GPS measurements. He has established more
than 100 permanent GPS stations in various tectonic domains of India and has made major
contributions in various seismic quantifications of the country. He is the recipient of several
awards including the PRL award in Earth and Planetary Sciences (2011), the CSIR Young
Scientist Award (2001), and the INSA Medal for Young Scientist Award (1997). He is the
co-author of Three Great Tsunamis: Lisbon (1755), Sumatraâ€“Andaman (2004) and Japan
(2011). He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2018."

        "title": "India plate motion and its interactions with Eurasian plate along the Himalayan and Indo-Burmese arc",
        "abstract": "Techniques such as geological mapping, subsurface imaging, and GPS measurements have
been providing valuable information towards quantification of plate tectonic forces or strain
budget and configuration of subsurface faults, thus helping understand earthquakes. GPS
measurements in the Indian subcontinent suggest that the India plate moves at a rate of
v 5 cm/year towards the northeast and deforms internally at a rate slower than 2 mm/year,
consistent with the relatively low seismicity in the plate interior regions. Along its northern
boundary in the Himalayan arc, it subducts under the Eurasian plate following a stick and
slip manner resulting in frequent earthquakes along the arc. The most detailed and dense
GPS measurements in the Garhwal Kumaon region of the Himalayan arc, imply a strain
accumulation corresponding to a slip deficit rate of 18 mm/year. Measurements also suggest
that coupling between the two plates is strong and homogeneous, making it the most
vulnerable seismic segment of the Himalaya which has not released strain in the past &gt;500
years. The speaker will discuss the GPS measurement studies performed by his team along
the Indo-Burmese arc. The results of the study suggest that a large part of plate motion
between the India and Sunda plate is accommodated along the Churachandpur Mao fault in
a predominant strike-slip manner ruling out subduction along this boundary."
