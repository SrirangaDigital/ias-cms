        "title": "Francis Crick: A renaissance scientist",
        "abstract": "Francis Crick – molecular biologist, physicist, and neuroscientist – is most known as the&#13;&#10;co-discoverer of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, along with his ideas of ‘central&#13;&#10;dogma’, and ‘wobble hypothesis’. While his early research was focused on revealing&#13;&#10;the genetic code, his later research at the Salk Institute, focussed on theoretical neurobiology&#13;&#10;and advancing the study of human consciousness. A true ‘renaissance scientist’ indeed.&#13;&#10;However, during the 1970s, some new discoveries questioned the assumptions he and Watson&#13;&#10;had made in their original theory of unidirectional genetic information transfer. Another&#13;&#10;of Crick’s ideas, viz ‘selfish DNA’, suggesting that nonsense sequences originated as DNA&#13;&#10;parasites and were eliminated by the host cell over time, is still to be proven. Nonetheless,&#13;&#10;Crick’s contributions towards assimilation of disparate ideas and experimental results from&#13;&#10;a wide range of disciplines, and to then propose new theories and suggest experiments are&#13;&#10;unparalleled in modern science. The talk will present a bird’s eye view of some of these&#13;&#10;ideas and the recent developments in these areas."

She is the Founder-Director of the Institute of Bioinformatics&#13;&#10;and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bengaluru, and is serving on the Advisory Board&#13;&#10;of the World Wide Protein Data Bank. She has been an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow&#13;&#10;at EMBL, Heidelberg and the Free University of Berlin, and a Senior Fulbright Fellow&#13;&#10;at UCSF, San Francisco. Her research is primarily focused on relating protein and DNA&#13;&#10;sequences to their structures and function by developing new concepts, computational algorithms,&#13;&#10;and tools, particularly in the area of DNA promoter architecture. She is a Fellow&#13;&#10;of all the three major science academies of India (FASc in 1998)."
