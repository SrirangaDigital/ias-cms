        "chairperson": "R Ramaswamy, JNU, New Delhi",
        "title": "Politics and violence: Ancient debates on a perennial problem",
        "abstract": "The recognition of the pragmatic need for the king to exercise a certain amount of force while discharging his duties and the positive value attached to the principle of non-violence created an enduring and irresoluble tension in the ancient Indian political thought. Focusing on the ancient debates on political violence in general and war, punishment, and the interface with the forest in particular, this lecture argues that there is no single ‘Indian’ theory of kingship or political violence. Rather, it is highlighted that there have been intense conversations and a variety of responses to the realities and challenges of political practice. The talk explores how the kings need to use force to maintain and strengthen his position was upheld while a distinction was made between necessary force and the force that was unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive or random. The lecture further argues that political violence was justified, aestheticized, and almost invisibilized, though a window of questioning and critique remained."
