        "title": "Politics and violence: Ancient debates on a perennial problem",
        "abstract": "The recognition of the pragmatic need for the king to exercise a certain amount of force&#13;&#10;while discharging his duties and the positive value attached to the principle of non-violence&#13;&#10;created an enduring and irresoluble tension in the ancient Indian political thought. Focusing&#13;&#10;on the ancient debates on political violence in general and war, punishment, and the&#13;&#10;interface with the forest in particular, this lecture argues that there is no single ‘Indian’ theory&#13;&#10;of kingship or political violence. Rather, it is highlighted that there have been intense&#13;&#10;conversations and a variety of responses to the realities and challenges of political practice.&#13;&#10;The talk explores how the kings need to use force to maintain and strengthen his position&#13;&#10;was upheld while a distinction was made between necessary force and the force that was&#13;&#10;unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive or random. The lecture further argues that political&#13;&#10;violence was justified, aestheticized, and almost invisibilized, though a window of&#13;&#10;questioning and critique remained."
