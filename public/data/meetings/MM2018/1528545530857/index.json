        "title": "Application of Raman spectroscopy from condense matter to biology",
        "abstract": "With the advent of nanotechnology, the scope of application of Raman spectroscopy has
extended beyond being a mere spectroscopic/characterization tool. Unfortunately, the full
potential of Raman spectroscopy remains unexplored. Due to the ease of application and its
ability to decipher interconnection with electronic states and spin states along with structural
and vibrational properties, Raman spectroscopy has an edge over many other tools
available and can be used to investigate the microscopic origin of molecular properties.
The talk will discuss such potentials of Raman spectroscopy based on studies conducted
on molecules of importance in condensed matter physics/biology. The first example is that
of 1T–TiTe2, a prominent layered 2D system topological insulator. The multiple indirect
signatures of electronic transition in 1T–TiTe2 will be discussed in connection with the recent
theoretical proposal for 1T–TiTe2, and also the possibility of an electronic topological
transition from electronic Fermi surface calculations. The talk will also discuss the use of
Raman spectroscopy in the investigation of molecular-level changes in the zeolitic imidazolate
framework ZIF-8, as a function of temperature. Further delving into the applications
of Raman spectroscopy in biology, the talk will highlight the use of surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) in understanding the selective inhibition of oncogenic Aurora A
Kinase by Felodipine."
