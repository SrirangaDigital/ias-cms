        "title": "Application of Raman spectroscopy from condense matter to biology",
        "abstract": "With the advent of nanotechnology, the scope of application of Raman spectroscopy has&#13;&#10;extended beyond being a mere spectroscopic/characterization tool. Unfortunately, the full&#13;&#10;potential of Raman spectroscopy remains unexplored. Due to the ease of application and its&#13;&#10;ability to decipher interconnection with electronic states and spin states along with structural&#13;&#10;and vibrational properties, Raman spectroscopy has an edge over many other tools&#13;&#10;available and can be used to investigate the microscopic origin of molecular properties.&#13;&#10;The talk will discuss such potentials of Raman spectroscopy based on studies conducted&#13;&#10;on molecules of importance in condensed matter physics/biology. The first example is that&#13;&#10;of 1T–TiTe2, a prominent layered 2D system topological insulator. The multiple indirect&#13;&#10;signatures of electronic transition in 1T–TiTe2 will be discussed in connection with the recent&#13;&#10;theoretical proposal for 1T–TiTe2, and also the possibility of an electronic topological&#13;&#10;transition from electronic Fermi surface calculations. The talk will also discuss the use of&#13;&#10;Raman spectroscopy in the investigation of molecular-level changes in the zeolitic imidazolate&#13;&#10;framework ZIF-8, as a function of temperature. Further delving into the applications&#13;&#10;of Raman spectroscopy in biology, the talk will highlight the use of surface enhanced Raman&#13;&#10;spectroscopy (SERS) in understanding the selective inhibition of oncogenic Aurora A&#13;&#10;Kinase by Felodipine."
