        "title": "Kala-azar – A neglected disease of poverty: Search for an affordable lasting cure",
        "abstract": "Kala-azar (KA) or visceral leishmaniasis, a debilitating and potentially fatal disease, is&#13;&#10;limited to the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. The disease is transmitted anthropologically&#13;&#10;and results in periodic epidemics. Control measures for KA are heavily dependent&#13;&#10;on chemotherapy. However, specific antileishmanial drugs are limited, and besides being&#13;&#10;unaffordable and toxic, are also associated with increasing microbial drug resistance. The&#13;&#10;depressed immune system of the infected host is also a stumbling block in controlling the&#13;&#10;disease. By and large, while a small infected population develops clinical symptoms, the&#13;&#10;majority remains asymptomatic contributing to the spread of the disease. Further, some patients&#13;&#10;develop post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), which also plays an important&#13;&#10;role in KA transmission. These are the major challenges faced by the WHO initiative for&#13;&#10;the eradication of KA by 2020. The situation calls for a two-pronged strategy – killing the&#13;&#10;parasite while boosting host immunity – to win the battle against KA."

        "biodata": "Anuradha Dube superannuated as Chief Scientist from CSIR-CDRI, Lucknow in 2015&#13;&#10;and is presently working as INSA Senior Scientist and J C Bose Fellow in the same lab.&#13;&#10;She works in the area of drug development and immunobiology of parasitic infections with&#13;&#10;a special focus on kala-azar. She has established the only available nonhuman primate&#13;&#10;model for preclinical evaluation of potential drug/vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis&#13;&#10;and has contributed to the identification and molecular characterization of leishmanial vital&#13;&#10;enzymes/proteins with Th1-stimulatory property as potential vaccine targets. Her group&#13;&#10;has also developed transgenic fluorescent parasite overexpressing green/ red fluorescent&#13;&#10;protein for drug screening/basic biology and has discovered non-toxic oral antileishmanial&#13;&#10;compounds from natural resources which could be potential drugs. She has published more&#13;&#10;than 170 papers in reputed journals and mentored 16 PhDs till date. She is a Fellow of the&#13;&#10;Indian National Science Academy (2013) and was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy&#13;&#10;of Sciences in 2015."
