        "abstract": "What happens when two neutron stars collide? Are these really the sources of most of&#13;&#10;the gold, platinum, and other heavy elements in the universe? After decades of theoretical&#13;&#10;speculation, researchers finally found the answer last August. Advanced gravitational wave&#13;&#10;detectors – LIGO and Virgo – discovered the coalescence of two neutron stars 130 million&#13;&#10;light years away from the Earth. At nearly the same time, Earth-orbiting satellites saw a&#13;&#10;flash of high energy radiation from the same direction. What followed was arguably the&#13;&#10;most frantic period of activity in modern astronomy, with over 3500 individuals from 950&#13;&#10;institutes joining forces to pinpoint the source in the sky and uncover its secrets. In this&#13;&#10;talk, the speaker will discuss this first binary neutron star merger, how it was found and&#13;&#10;understood, and what it means for in the days to come."

        "biodata": "Varun Bhalerao is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay. He&#13;&#10;received his PhD in astrophysics from Caltech and joined as a Vaidya-Raychaudhuri Postdoctoral&#13;&#10;Fellow at IUCAA, Pune. He later obtained the DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship&#13;&#10;and has since joined the Department of Physics at IIT Bombay. His research interests span&#13;&#10;astrophysical observations and instrumentation. He leads the Indian efforts for electromagnetic&#13;&#10;follow-up of gravitational wave sources. He is a part of the international GROWTH&#13;&#10;collaboration, which has been extremely successful in the study of GW170817 – the only&#13;&#10;gravitational wave source detected so far with an electromagnetic counterpart. He is also&#13;&#10;working to set up India’s first fully robotic telescope at Hanle, Ladakh. He led the calibrations&#13;&#10;for Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager, one of the telescopes on board AstroSat. He was&#13;&#10;selected an Associate of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2017."
