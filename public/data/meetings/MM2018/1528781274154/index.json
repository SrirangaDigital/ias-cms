        "title": "Thinking long-term in ecology: Insights from 3-decades of monitoring a tropical forest in Mudumalai",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of ecosystems may vary considerably across natural ecological gradients&#13;&#10;such as elevation and rainfall, as well as over time because of interannual variability in&#13;&#10;climatic factors. Hence, spatiotemporal scales and long-term monitoring become important&#13;&#10;considerations in understanding the underlying functioning of natural ecosystems.&#13;&#10;Mudumalai, a dry forest landscape in southern India along a sharp rainfall gradient, has&#13;&#10;been the site of long-term ecological research including floristics, forest dynamics, invasive&#13;&#10;species ecology, and fire ecology. A 50-ha permanent plot was set up in the dry-deciduous&#13;&#10;forest in 1988. This was followed in 1994 by nineteen 1-ha permanent plots spanning&#13;&#10;several vegetation types and rainfall regimes. The individual fate of over 80,000 individuals&#13;&#10;from nearly 200 species of woody plants has been monitored over nearly three decades in&#13;&#10;these sites. These long-term studies provide crucial insights in terms of the biotic and&#13;&#10;abiotic factors affecting tree diversity, growth, and survival in this forest.&#13;&#10;The monitoring has also provided new insights into theoretical issues in ecology. Overall,&#13;&#10;the importance of environmental stochasticity has been clear not only in the low-rainfall,&#13;&#10;seasonally dry tropical forests of Mudumalai but surprisingly across a global network of&#13;&#10;tropical forest plots extending to rainforests. Such long-term studies have particular relevance&#13;&#10;to predicting tropical forest response to future climate change"

        "biodata": "Raman Sukumar, Professor of Ecology at IISc, Bengaluru, is known for his pioneering research on the ecology,&#13;&#10;behaviour, and conservation of Asian elephants. His research interests are tropical forest ecology and climate&#13;&#10;change. In 1988 he established the country’s longest-running ecological monitoring programme in the Western&#13;&#10;Ghats and has contributed extensively to Indian government policy on conservation. The author of four books on&#13;&#10;the elephant and many scientific papers, he is the recipient of several national and international awards, the most&#13;&#10;notable being the International Cosmos Prize in 2006. He also contributed to the work of IPCC that shared the&#13;&#10;Nobel Peace Prize (2007). His most recent scientific contribution is an edited volume Tropical Conservation:&#13;&#10;Perspectives on Local and Global Priorities (Oxford University Press, New York, 2017). Currently, he is a&#13;&#10;Visiting Professor at the Institute of Advanced Study, Kyoto University, Japan. He is an elected Fellow of&#13;&#10;TWAS and all the three major science academies in India (FASc in 2000)."
