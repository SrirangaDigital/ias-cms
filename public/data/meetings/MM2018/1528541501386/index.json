        "title": "The subconvexity problem",
        "abstract": "Estimating the size of L-functions inside the critical strip is a central problem in the analytic&#13;&#10;theory of numbers. This problem has a long history originating in the works of Lindelf&#13;&#10;around 1908. Subconvex estimates often have deep implications. In this talk, the speaker&#13;&#10;will briefly describe the salient features of this important problem"
