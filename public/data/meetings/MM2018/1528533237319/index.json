        "abstract": "Blindness is a major public health concern, and India shares a disproportionate share of&#13;&#10;the burden. India is home to nearly 20 per cent of the worldâ€™s blind. Epidemiologic research&#13;&#10;has helped us develop an available, accessible and affordable healthcare delivery&#13;&#10;model. A comprehensive system of high-quality eye health model has been developed and&#13;&#10;implemented in three states of India. Translational research has also enhanced the quality&#13;&#10;of outcomes from cataract surgeries, while advances in stem cell transplantation of cornea&#13;&#10;have helped in treating some recalcitrant problems, offering the promise of sight restoration&#13;&#10;in cases of retinal degenerations. Increasing applications of technology have enhanced the&#13;&#10;scale, access, and quality of health care programs. Technological innovations that bring the&#13;&#10;benefits of the best of such technologies to the most marginalized will be presented."
