        "title": "Challenges in extending symbiotic nitrogen fixation beyond current host range",
        "abstract": "Only a handful of selected plants restricted to a monophyletic clade within angiosperms&#13;&#10;are blessed with the ability to undertake symbiotic nitrogen fixation. It is a mutualistic&#13;&#10;relationship between a plant and a nitrogen-fixing bacteria and involves carbonâ€“nitrogen&#13;&#10;exchange. Symbionts are accommodated in the intracellular organelle-like compartments&#13;&#10;in a microaerophilic niche where they convert atmospheric N2 to NH3, thereby giving an&#13;&#10;endogenous source of fertilizer to the host plants. There is considerable interest in exploring&#13;&#10;whether similar symbioses can be engineered in our crop plants to reduce their&#13;&#10;dependence on nitrogenous fertilizers. Prime candidates that are responsible for the adaptations&#13;&#10;to symbiotic nitrogen fixation would be discussed in the backdrop of the challenges&#13;&#10;to its extension to plants outside the competent clade."

She did her PhD from Bose Institute, Kolkata, and postdoc from the University&#13;&#10;of Texas, USA. Her research aims at delineating molecular principles that underlie the&#13;&#10;symbiotic interactions between plants and nitrogen-fixing bacteria where she focuses on&#13;&#10;understanding the adaptation of receptor kinases to accommodate the beneficial bacteria in&#13;&#10;host plants. She is an elected Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India and the&#13;&#10;West Bengal Academy of Science and Technology. She was elected a Fellow of the Indian&#13;&#10;Academy of Sciences in 2018."
