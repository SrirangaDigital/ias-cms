        "title": "Hydrological extremes and hazard modeling – Exploring the intricacies and predictability of the regional hydrologic system",
        "abstract": "Hydrological extremes, though rare, have always existed, adversely affecting the economy,&#13;&#10;in the form of floods and droughts. The rarity and intensity of such events often jeopardize&#13;&#10;the management policies undertaken. Recently, India has witnessed an increase in the&#13;&#10;occurrence of hydrologic extremes, i.e., floods, droughts, and heat waves, the impacts of&#13;&#10;which proved to be much detrimental to the Indian society and economy, especially due&#13;&#10;to the lack of any systematic early warning systems and subsequent strategic planning.&#13;&#10;These extremes increase the stress undertaken by the water sector owing to the compounding&#13;&#10;effects of climate change, growing population, and globalization, with implications for&#13;&#10;food and energy security, ecology and environment, critical infrastructures and emergency&#13;&#10;preparedness, as well as human lives, health, and economy. The talk will elaborate the research&#13;&#10;attempted to gain fundamental insights into such hydrological extremes and towards&#13;&#10;improving hydrological modeling to aid the development of early-warning methods and&#13;&#10;policies for sustainable water resources and hazard management. The two-fold approach&#13;&#10;undertaken: (i) Statistical learning from time series of observations, and (ii) Theoretical&#13;&#10;modeling hydrological and holistic models to simulate the regional hydrological cycle&#13;&#10;behavior, will be covered. Major research outputs and accomplishments, so far, will be&#13;&#10;comprehended."

She attempts to generate a fundamental&#13;&#10;scientific understanding of hydrological extremes along with improvising hydrological&#13;&#10;modeling, to provide early-warning methods and adaptation policies for sustainable&#13;&#10;water resources management. She is the recipient of numerous awards including the NASI&#13;&#10;Young Scientist Platinum Jubilee Award (2017), the Young Researcher Award – Ministry&#13;&#10;of Earth Sciences (2017), and the DAAD Faculty Exchange Scholarship to serve as a visiting&#13;&#10;faculty in Forschungszentrum Jlich, Germany. She was selected as an Associate of the&#13;&#10;Indian Academy of Sciences in 2016."
