        "title": "The evolving story of protein–polyphenol interactions",
        "abstract": "Protein interactions form the basis of all life processes – whether the interaction is between&#13;&#10;two proteins, a protein and a nuclei acid or a protein and a small molecule. In this&#13;&#10;context, recent years have seen increasing interest in protein–polyphenol interactions with&#13;&#10;researchers investigating the interactions of polyphenols (e.g. green tea polyphenols) with&#13;&#10;various human proteins. Such interactions affect protein functionality in various ways. For&#13;&#10;example, polyphenols present in green tea were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of&#13;&#10;Ribonuclease A, while they also inhibit angiogenesis – the capacity to form blood vessels.&#13;&#10;Protein condensation/aggregation, the hallmark of many diseases triggered research involving&#13;&#10;human serum albumin, lysozyme, and the amyloid peptide Aβ25−35 that established the&#13;&#10;vital role of Cu(II) and the effect of additives on the fibrillation process. Green tea polyphenols&#13;&#10;were also observed to protect human γB-crystallin from UV radiation-induced damage&#13;&#10;and aggregation. Modified γ-crystallin has been isolated from discarded cataractous emulsion&#13;&#10;of patients to examine changes in the protein. The eye protein isolate is being explored&#13;&#10;for nanoparticle/film preparation to be used in possible drug/compound delivery"
