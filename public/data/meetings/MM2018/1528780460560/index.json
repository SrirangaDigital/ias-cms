        "title": "Identification of a host biomarker signature for detecting tuberculosis through a blood test",
        "abstract": "Efficient diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is met with multiple challenges, calling for a shift&#13;&#10;of focus from pathogen-centric diagnostics towards the identification of host-based multimarker&#13;&#10;signatures. Transcriptomics offer a list of differentially expressed genes, but cannot&#13;&#10;by itself identify the most influential contributors to the disease phenotype. The speaker will&#13;&#10;discuss a computational pipeline that adopts an unbiased approach to investigate host factors&#13;&#10;that are altered significantly due to TB to identify a biomarker signature. The pipeline&#13;&#10;is based on the integration of various techniques including network-mapping of RNA-Seq&#13;&#10;data of TB patients, systemic identification of variations in healthy and TB samples, sensitive&#13;&#10;network mining to shortlist gene candidates central to disease alterations, and application&#13;&#10;of a series of filters. The study has resulted in the identification of a signature&#13;&#10;comprising 10 genes that can discriminate between TB and healthy controls as well as distinguish&#13;&#10;TB from latent tuberculosis and HIV in most cases. The potential of this signature&#13;&#10;as a diagnostic marker of TB will be discussed."
