        "title": "Transition metal-catalyzed selective functionalization of metallocarbenes to Nheterocycles",
        "abstract": "Transition metal-catalyzed functionalization of α-diazocarbonyl compounds has found widespread application because of their ability to produce reactive metallocarbene intermediates. These metal carbenes have been proved capable of delivering a variety of useful transformations including traditional reactions like cyclopropanation, X-(C)H insertion and ylides. Recent studies focus extensively on the three component approach and functionalization of nitrogen analogue of α-diazocarbonyl compounds, viz. α-diazoimines, with various coupling partners. In this presentation, the speaker will describe his recent efforts in the synthesis and transition metal-catalyzed functionalization of α-diazocarbonyl compounds and its nitrogen analogue."
