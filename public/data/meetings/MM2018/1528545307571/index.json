        "title": "Transition metal-catalyzed selective functionalization of metallocarbenes to Nheterocycles",
        "abstract": "Transition metal-catalyzed functionalization of α-diazocarbonyl compounds has found widespread&#13;&#10;application because of their ability to produce reactive metallocarbene intermediates.&#13;&#10;These metal carbenes have been proved capable of delivering a variety of useful transformations&#13;&#10;including traditional reactions like cyclopropanation, X-(C)H insertion and ylides.&#13;&#10;Recent studies focus extensively on the three component approach and functionalization&#13;&#10;of nitrogen analogue of α-diazocarbonyl compounds, viz. α-diazoimines, with various&#13;&#10;coupling partners. In this presentation, the speaker will describe his recent efforts in the&#13;&#10;synthesis and transition metal-catalyzed functionalization of α-diazocarbonyl compounds&#13;&#10;and its nitrogen analogue."
