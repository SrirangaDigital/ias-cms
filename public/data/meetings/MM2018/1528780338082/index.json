        "title": "Structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of confined water",
        "abstract": "Water is the essence of life and various properties of water molecules have intrigued researchers&#13;&#10;from time immemorial. The speaker studies various translational and orientational&#13;&#10;dynamics of water molecules confined inside a carbon nanotube using atomistic&#13;&#10;molecular dynamics simulation and tries to understand the thermodynamics of water entering&#13;&#10;inside a hydrophobic nanotube by calculating the Helmholtz free energy of water&#13;&#10;using two-phase thermodynamic method. Based on these studies, the speaker has proposed&#13;&#10;a mechanism of water permeation in helium impermeable graphene oxide (GO) membrane&#13;&#10;using the calculation of potential of mean force (PMF). PMF calculations of the oxidized&#13;&#10;part of the GO sheets in helium and oxidized part of the GO in water will be discussed&#13;&#10;highlighting the difference in their permeation path."
