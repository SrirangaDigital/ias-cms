his PhD in Physics from IIT Kanpur, followed by postdoctoral stays at MPIP-Mainz, the
University of Colorado at Boulder, and Caltech, USA. He primarily works in the area of
multiscale modelling of soft and bio-materials. Areas of current research interest include
structure and dynamics of dendrimers, DNA-based nanotechnology, DNA-dendrimer complexation,
and properties of water under strong confinement. He was elected a Fellow of
the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2018."

        "abstract": "Water is the essence of life and various properties of water molecules have intrigued researchers
from time immemorial. The speaker studies various translational and orientational
dynamics of water molecules confined inside a carbon nanotube using atomistic
molecular dynamics simulation and tries to understand the thermodynamics of water entering
inside a hydrophobic nanotube by calculating the Helmholtz free energy of water
using two-phase thermodynamic method. Based on these studies, the speaker has proposed
a mechanism of water permeation in helium impermeable graphene oxide (GO) membrane
using the calculation of potential of mean force (PMF). PMF calculations of the oxidized
part of the GO sheets in helium and oxidized part of the GO in water will be discussed
highlighting the difference in their permeation path."
