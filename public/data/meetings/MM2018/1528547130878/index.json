        "title": "RNA G-quadruplex: Re-Search",
        "abstract": "RNA G-quadruplexes in untranslated regions (UTR) are known to play an important role&#13;&#10;in translational regulation. The classic G-quadruplex motif consists of a continuous array&#13;&#10;of 3–4 guanine residues with an intermittent loop size of 1–7 nucleotides (G3−4N1−7G3−4&#13;&#10;N1−7G3−4N1−7G3−4). Investigating the possibilities of formation of RNA G-quadruplex with&#13;&#10;a stretch of sequence deviating from this classic motif will add to the overall conformations&#13;&#10;of RNA G-quadruplex bestowing diversity to this structure. In this presentation, the speaker&#13;&#10;will discuss the possibilities of unusual combinations of guanine residues involved in RNA&#13;&#10;G-quadruplex formation in the 50 UTR of different genes."
