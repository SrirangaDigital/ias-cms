        "title": "Reliability of CMOS IC chips – from atoms to processors",
        "abstract": "Integrated circuit (IC) chips are ubiquitous in all electronic products used today. The semiconductor&#13;&#10;industry has made tremendous progress in delivering ICs with increased performance&#13;&#10;over the years, resulting in better products. However, during operation, these ICs&#13;&#10;degrade over time and eventually fail. Therefore, the industry must ensure that the reliability&#13;&#10;(or rate of failure) of these ICs is not compromised when a new technology is developed&#13;&#10;and delivered and that the products should operate over their specified usage life. In this&#13;&#10;talk, the speaker will discuss the methodologies and models for predetermining the ageing&#13;&#10;and failure of these chips – from technology (transistors) to full chip (circuits) level. These&#13;&#10;methods are helpful in accessing and rectifying potential reliability issues during CMOS&#13;&#10;(complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology qualification."
