        "biodata": "In 1992 I had joined TIFR as a graduate student in the experimental high energy physics, where I had worked in the L3 experiment for my Ph.D. thesis, ``Search for supersymmetric particle in e+e- collisions at LEP", but my main contribution was to choose the material for the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter, its size, shape etc. The discovery of Higgs boson from the CMS experiment had come from that subdetector. After completing my Ph.D., I had joined Syracuse university, New York in March 1998 for my Post Doctoral work, where I was developing software code for the CLEO-III Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector as well as did feasibility study for the proposed BTeV experiment at FNAL. I had returned back to TIFR as fellow(D) in December 2000. Initially I had worked for the BELLE experiment for the discovery of new charmonium resonances and also changed the concept of physics with missing energy measurements at asymmetric e+e- machine. I had a crucial role for the construction, calibration and installation of CMS outer hadron calorimeter. I am contributing to the study of the Standard Model physics at CMS experiment along with the development of software tools and new idea to improve the performance of the CMS detector. In parallel, I have developed the complete INO simulation and reconstruction code from the scratch and taking part in aspect of INO. At present I am holding professor position at TIFR and in 2016 I have been elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Science, India (NASI)."

        "title": "A Journey to the Discovery of Higgs Boson",
        "abstract": "The Higgs boson was predicted in 1964 to provide masses of the carrier of electro-weak interactions, but did not predict any specific mass of Higgs boson and had a range from zero to 1 TeV. In nineties, experiments at Large Electron Position (LEP) collider at CERN, Geneva looked for the signature of Higgs bosons and gradually ruled out Higgs with lower mass (&gt;114.4 GeV). In parallel experimentals on proton-proton collision at Tevatron, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), USA also ended up with the null results. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Geneva was constructed mainly to look for this boson and within few years of the operations, experiments at LHC had discovered Higgs boson in 2012. In this talk I will try to give a summary of various steps of this journey"
