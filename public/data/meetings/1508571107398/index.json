        "title": "A journey to the discovery of Higgs Boson",
        "abstract": "The Higgs Boson was predicted in 1964 to provide masses of the carrier of electro-weak interactions; it was ascribed a range of 0–1 TeV but was not attributed with a specific mass. In the nineties, experiments at Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, Geneva, looked for the signature of Higgs Bosons and gradually ruled out Higgs with lower masses (&gt;114.4 GeV). In parallel experiments on proton–proton collision at Tevatron, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), USA also ended up with the null results. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at Geneva, was constructed mainly to look for this Boson, and within few years of operation, experiments at LHC led to the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. In this talk, various steps of this journey will be summarised."
