        "title": "Dilli door Ast? The margins, memory and identity",
        "abstract": "The many competing groups of the region that is called the North-east may be strangers to each other, but they are no strangers to history. History is a close and at times a terrible and unforgiving companion. Attitudes are formed by experiences, narrated in stories; these stories become texts, are embedded in books and taught to generations who pass on the word. The volume of words become a torrent of cement and brick, building high walls of division. Those inside the wall believe they are specially privileged. Those outside are the *bahiror* *mahuh*, the outsiders. For long, this region has been viewed as being at the margins – yet these very margins have forged a narrative over decades that have forced New Delhi and all of India to listen and take notice of their demands.
