He was the Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, during August 2008-2015. He set up the state-of-the-art tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean and provided tsunami advisories to the Indian Ocean rim countries. He has pioneered applications of remote sensing to coastal and marine environments, and developed products for coastal management and services for fishery and ocean state forecast. He was instrumental in initiating studies related to reservoir-induced seismicity. He is Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, India, the International Society of Photogrammetry &amp; Remote Sensing and Academician of the International Academy of Astronautics. He was conferred the ISC Vikram Sarabhai Memorial Award-2012. He has published about 150 papers in SCI journals."

        "title": "Towards Understanding of Triggered Earthquakes",
        "abstract": "Triggered earthquakes have been receiving an increased attention by the scientific community world over. Artificial water reservoirs are known to induce seismcity and known as Reservoir-Induced Seismcity (RTS). The Shivaji Sagar and later the Warna reservoirs at Koyna have induced earthquakes during last 50 years and many studies have been carried out to understand this phenomenon. However, the current models do not explain their genesis as direct observational data along the fault plane are lacking. In order to understand reservoir-induced seismicity, scientific deep drilling, about 5-7 km deep has been undertaken at Koyna. A fault-zone observatory has been planned to make observations related to changes in physical and chemical properties during as well as before and after earthquakes. An exploratory phase has been completed by drilling 9 shallow boreholes (upto 1.5 km) and deploying seismometers. These observations provided hypocentral location and disposition of fault zones responsible for these earthquakes. Based on these data sets, an pilot bore-hole has been drilled up to 3 km recently. Geophysical measurements to characterise physical properties of rocks, hydrofrac measurements to measure stress regime, gas sampling, and measurement of strength and elastic properties of basement rocks were carried out. Geomicrobiological studies to understand life under extreme conditions have been undertaken. This study also provided for the first time exact thickness of Deccan basalt (1241 m) and pene plane nature of granitic basement. The current results and future plans to answer many questions related to reservoir-trigger seismicity, will be presented."
