        "title": "Understanding the mechanisms that prevent carcinogenesis by studying a family of caretaker tumour suppressors",
        "abstract": "Deciphering the molecular basis of the tumour suppressor functions is vital to understanding how the process of carcinogenesis is evaded under normal physiological conditions. In eukaryotic cells both the nucleus and the mitochondria encode genetic materials, which when mutated, potentiates the cells to undergo neoplastic transformation, which is the first step towards carcinogenesis. Further, the mitochondrial and nuclear genome inter-regulate each otherâ€™s functions during the genome maintenance process. The members of RecQ helicase family of tumour suppressors, exemplified by BLM and RECQL4 helicases, play crucial roles in DNA repair, replication and recombination. BLM helicase regulates DNA repair processes like homologous recombination and stimulates the ATPase and chromatin remodelling, thereby allowing better access to the repair complexes. Phosphorylation and ubiquitylation cascades activate BLM functions during the above processes. Further, BLM can enhance the degradation of multiple pro-carcinogenic oncoproteins and thereby maintains genome stability. RECQL4 is the second known mitochondrial helicase and plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial DNA replication. In summary, using a class of caretaker tumour suppressors, the mechanisms of maintenance of genome stability have been elucidated. The results have shown how the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are both required to maintain genomic integrity."
