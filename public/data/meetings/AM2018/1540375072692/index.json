        "title": "Discovering CP violation in the lepton sector: Challenges and possibilities",
        "abstract": "Discovering CP violation in the lepton sector constitutes one of the most&#13;&#10;challenging tasks in the field of high energy physics. In this talk, the&#13;&#10;speaker will discuss the difficulties in determination of the leptonic CP&#13;&#10;violating phase and to what extent the future experiments can explore&#13;&#10;this. The speaker will also discuss the possible role played by the India-Based Neutrino Observatory&#13;&#10;experiment in this endeavor."
