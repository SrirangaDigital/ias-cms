        "title": "Translational research approach: Primary congenital glaucoma – Prevalence, genetics and collaboration between scientists and clinicians for successful treatment ",
        "abstract": "Primary congential glaucoma (PCG) is a group of diseases in which high&#13;&#10;fluid pressure in the eye damages the optic nerve. It affects children&#13;&#10;between birth and 3 years and untreated cases are a major cause of childhood&#13;&#10;blindness. Early detection and clinical treatment can save the sight of the infant. Of the&#13;&#10;several genes associated with PCG, the speaker’s group has done some extensive work on the&#13;&#10;gene CYP1B1, and how the mutation R368H in CYP1B1 is seen across the world, which appears&#13;&#10;to suggest the possibility of the origin and spread of the disease itself. Molecular modeling of&#13;&#10;the protein, identification of the promoter in the expression of the gene, and treatment modes&#13;&#10;have also been worked out. A clinical colleague has successfully treated hundreds of children,&#13;&#10;followed up with them and shown how well many of these have succeeded in life. This is an&#13;&#10;example of what is referred to as Translational Research– ‘lab bench to patient’s bedside and on&#13;&#10;to the community’."

        "biodata": "D Balasubramanian has been single-mindedly involved in the promotion and enhancement&#13;&#10;of eye research in India as Director of Research, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, since&#13;&#10;1998, where he encouraged ophthalmologists to not only treat but also enter into research. He&#13;&#10;helped establish the Indian Eye Research Group, established collaborative research with other&#13;&#10;centers and has started the field of stem cell research and therapy for eye diseases in India.&#13;&#10;He has contributed to the growth and expansion of the field of biochemistry and molecular&#13;&#10;biology, with special reference to the area of ‘protein diseases’ such as cataract of the eye,&#13;&#10;brain disorders, by pointing out how misfolding of the protein chain leads to pathology. For&#13;&#10;his contributions to popular science, he has been awarded UNESCO’s Kalinga Prize in 1999,&#13;&#10;and the Indira Gandhi Prize for the Popularization of Science. He has been awarded Padma&#13;&#10;Shri in 2002, and also Civilian Honor of France, ‘Chevalier de l’Ordre National du Merite’,&#13;&#10;2002. He is elected Fellow of all three scientific academies of India, and was President of&#13;&#10;Indian Academy of Sciences (2009–2012). "
