        "session": "SESSION 1D: Symposium: Materials of Today and Tomorrow",
        "chairperson": "A K Ganguli, IIT Delhi",
        "title": "Rational design of materials with tailored functionalities",
        "abstract": "New functional materials, with tailored functionalities, can be designed by interplay of synthesis and crystallographic structures. Of late, the focus of research has been shifted to multi-functional materials, i.e., the materials that can possess two or more synergistic or antagonistic functionalities. The synthesis of such materials has been a challenge and also an opportunity to chemists. The speaker and his team have prepared several new functional materials guided by crystallographic approach coupled with novel synthesis protocols. Some materials which will be discussed include RE1â€“xCexCrO3 (materials with tunable band gap and magnetic properties), CeScO3, Ce2Zr2O7+x (oxygen storage capacitors), tunable-dielectrics in hexagonal-ABO3 systems and several lead free relaxor materials. The talk will focus on the role of synthesis, novel properties exhibited by these functional materials, and their crystallographic correlation."
