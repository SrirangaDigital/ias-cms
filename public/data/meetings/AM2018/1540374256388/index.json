        "session": "SESSION 1D: Symposium: Materials of Today and Tomorrow",
        "chairperson": "A K Ganguli, IIT Delhi",
        "title": "Rational design of materials with tailored functionalities",
        "abstract": "New functional materials, with tailored functionalities, can be designed&#13;&#10;by interplay of synthesis and crystallographic structures. Of late, the&#13;&#10;focus of research has been shifted to multi-functional materials, i.e., the&#13;&#10;materials that can possess two or more synergistic or antagonistic functionalities.&#13;&#10;The synthesis of such materials has been a challenge and also&#13;&#10;an opportunity to chemists. The speaker and his team have prepared several new functional&#13;&#10;materials guided by crystallographic approach coupled with novel synthesis protocols. Some&#13;&#10;materials which will be discussed include RE1â€“xCexCrO3 (materials with tunable band gap and&#13;&#10;magnetic properties), CeScO3, Ce2Zr2O7+x&#13;&#10; (oxygen storage capacitors), tunable-dielectrics in hexagonal-ABO3&#13;&#10; systems and several lead free relaxor materials. The talk will focus on the role of&#13;&#10;synthesis, novel properties exhibited by these functional materials, and their crystallographic&#13;&#10;correlation."
