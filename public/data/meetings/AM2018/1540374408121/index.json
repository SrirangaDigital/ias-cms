        "title": "Low thermal conductive chalcogenides for high performance thermoelectric energy conversion",
        "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges in developing high-performance&#13;&#10;thermoelectric materials has been to achieve low lattice thermal conductivity&#13;&#10;(κL). Intrinsic low thermal conductivity is of practical interest&#13;&#10;due to its robustness against grain size, temperature range and other&#13;&#10;structural variations. The exploration of new materials with intrinsically low κL along with a&#13;&#10;microscopic understanding of the underlying correlations among bonding, lattice dynamics&#13;&#10;and phonon transport is fundamentally important towards designing promising thermoelectric&#13;&#10;materials. Zintl compounds, TlInTe2&#13;&#10;, exhibit ultralow κL due to low energy ratting modes&#13;&#10;(optical modes) of weakly bound Tl+. These low energy optic phonon modes are strongly anharmonic,&#13;&#10;which scatter the heat-carrying acoustic phonons through phonon–phonon interactions,&#13;&#10;thereby decrease the thermal conductivity. Soft phonon modes and optical–acoustic phonon&#13;&#10;coupling cause an ultralow κL in the room-temperature hexagonal phase of AgCuTe, while the&#13;&#10;dynamic disorder of Ag/Cu cations leads to reduced phonon frequencies and mean free paths in&#13;&#10;the high-temperature rocksalt phase. A high zT of 1.6 is achieved in the p-type AgCuTe at ~670&#13;&#10;K. The speakers’s group has recently shown that the localized vibrations of Bi bilayer lead to&#13;&#10;ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric performance in weak topological&#13;&#10;insulator n-type BiSe near room temperature."
