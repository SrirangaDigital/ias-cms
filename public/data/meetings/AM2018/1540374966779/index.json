        "title": "Organophosphate hydrolase exists as part of Ton complex in Sphingobium fuliginis ATCC27551 and plays a role in active transport of nutrients across energy deprived outer membrane",
        "abstract": "In soil bacterium Sphingobium fuliginis, organophosphate hydrolase&#13;&#10;(OPH) exists as part of Ton complex comprising of TonB, ExbB/ExbD.&#13;&#10;The OPH physically interacts with both ExbD and TonB. The surface&#13;&#10;exposed arginine residues (R91 and R96) of OPH facilitate its physical interaction with ExbD.&#13;&#10;A functional Ton complex forms in heterologous systems only when OPH is co-expressed with&#13;&#10;ExbB and ExbD. The OPH hydrolyzes the lactone ring present in enterobactin and facilitates&#13;&#10;the release of iron strongly bound to enterobactin. The Sphingobium fuliginis TonB dependent&#13;&#10;transport (SfTonBDT) system complemented E. coli TonBDT null mutant. The cells having SfTon&#13;&#10;complex with OPH showed better growth and enhanced iron uptake when compared to a similar&#13;&#10;strain generated without OPH. The study by the speaker and his group reveals existence of novel&#13;&#10;TonB dependent transport system in S. fuliginis ATCC 27551."
