        "chairperson": "S Ananthakrishnan, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune",
        "title": "Impact of copy number variations in genome organization, evolution and diseases",
        "abstract": "The speaker and his group have performed genome-wide genotyping by&#13;&#10;CNV microarray analysis and identified 44,109 CNVs from 1,715 genomes&#13;&#10;across 12 populations to unravel genomic variations in human genome&#13;&#10;organization, evolution and some complex diseases. Some of their findings,&#13;&#10;including the identification of the complexity in chromosome organization, genome organizational&#13;&#10;plasticity and the proposal of human new migration routes, establishment of the&#13;&#10;previously identified X chromosome Transposed Region (XTR) in Y-chromosome as pseudoautosomal&#13;&#10;region 3 (PAR3), and identification of the type 2 diabetes mellitus disease risk genes,&#13;&#10;Parkinson Disease risk genes and Asthma susceptibility marker genes under CNV burden in normal&#13;&#10;cohorts, will be discussed with reference to the role of CNVs in the genomic variations."

        "biodata": "N B Ramachandra joined the University of Mysore as a Lecturer in Zoology in 1992. He was&#13;&#10;instrumental in starting the master’s course in Genetics there, and is now the Chairman of&#13;&#10;the Department of Studies in Genetics and Genomics, University of Mysore. His research&#13;&#10;interests are in the field of Drosophila and human genetics, evolution and genomics. His&#13;&#10;significant contributions include evidences for adaptive genome evolution in Drosophila,&#13;&#10;identification of SNPs and CNVs for several diseases, advanced grandmother age as a cause&#13;&#10;for Down’s syndrome, identification of a new recombining region, PAR3, and establishment&#13;&#10;of University of Mysore Genome Centre database. He has published more than 200 research&#13;&#10;papers and delivered more than 200 invited lectures. His work has been recognised by many&#13;&#10;awards. In 2017, he was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru."
