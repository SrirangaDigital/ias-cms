        "title": "Battery materials for electric vehicles: Today and tomorrow",
        "abstract": "Electric mobility provides some respite against our increasingly deteriorating&#13;&#10;environment by deploying hybrid and electric vehicles. Affordability,&#13;&#10;however, could act as a barrier in minimizing the carbon footprint for&#13;&#10;the benefit of future generations (sustainability). This talk will explain&#13;&#10;the design of battery materials involved in zero-emission transportation&#13;&#10;after a brief history of rechargeable Li-ion batteries, examining all the options available for electric&#13;&#10;mobility. Various aspects of the National mobility programme including the plan to replace&#13;&#10;vehicles in India by 2030 using fuel cells, Li-ion, Na-ion, Li-air and other futuristic batteries will&#13;&#10;be discussed. The future of personalized as well as public transport will be examined in the light&#13;&#10;of recent innovative trends like smart battery materials, driver-less and flying cars using unprecedented&#13;&#10;technological advancements in materials science, computational capability, machine&#13;&#10;intelligence and mega-data analysis.
