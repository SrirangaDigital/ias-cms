        "session": "Session 1B: Inaugural lectures by Fellows",
        "chairperson": "Dhananjai Pandey, BHU, Varanasi",
        "title": "DNA inspired physics",
        "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed an intense activity in experiments involving&#13;&#10;the manipulation of single DNA. This interest has been fueled on&#13;&#10;the one hand by the desire to understand the fundamental mechanisms&#13;&#10;at play in DNA molecule, and on the other hand by the development of&#13;&#10;revolutionary single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments, which&#13;&#10;provide unprecedented insights into the strength of the inter and intra-molecular forces driving&#13;&#10;biological processes, e.g., replication and transcription. The speaker has proposed a generic&#13;&#10;model of DNA under the influence of external force and has studied different properties associated&#13;&#10;with DNA. It was shown that the proposed model is rich enough to resolve many long&#13;&#10;standing issues. Some of these issues will be briefly reviewed in this talk."

        "biodata": "Sanjay Kumar is currently engaged in teaching and research at Banaras Hindu University.&#13;&#10;After graduating from Bhagalpur University, he joined the M.Sc. (Physics) programme in&#13;&#10;Kumaun University. Prior to joining BHU as a faculty member in the year 1997, he was&#13;&#10;a Lecturer in Physics at the Physics Department of Tripura University (North East region)&#13;&#10;during 1991â€“1997. As the department was in the inception stage, he worked hard in developing&#13;&#10;the department and popularizing science in that region. He is the recipient of Indian&#13;&#10;National Science Academy Medal for Young Scientists (1996), Boyscast Fellow of Department&#13;&#10;of Science and Technology (1998) and Simons Associates of ICTP, Italy (2015). In 2016, he&#13;&#10;was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru."
