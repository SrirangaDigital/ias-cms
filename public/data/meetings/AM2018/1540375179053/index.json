        "title": "Importance of cellular organelles in controlling the miRNA-mediated gene expression in mammalian cells",
        "abstract": "miRNA-mediated repression controls the expression of more than half&#13;&#10;of the protein coding genes in metazoan animals. Translation repression&#13;&#10;is associated with target mRNA degradation initiated by decapping&#13;&#10;and deadenylation of the repressed mRNAs. Earlier evidence suggests&#13;&#10;Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) as the site where miRNPs interact with their targets before the&#13;&#10;translation repression sets in, but the subcellular location of subsequent degradation of miRNA&#13;&#10;repressed messages was unidentified. The speaker and his group has explored the subcellular&#13;&#10;distribution of essential components of degradation machineries of miRNA-target mRNAs. They&#13;&#10;have noted that interaction of target mRNAs with AGO2 protein on ER precedes the relocalization&#13;&#10;of repressed messages to Multivesicular Bodies (MVBs). The repressed messages subsequently&#13;&#10;get deadenylated, lose their interaction with AGO2 and also become decapped. Blocking&#13;&#10;maturation of endosomes to late endosome and MVBs by targeting the endosomal protein HRS,&#13;&#10;uncouples miRNA-mediated translation repression from target RNA degradation. HRS is also&#13;&#10;targeted by the intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani that curtails HRS level in infected&#13;&#10;cells to prevent uncoupling of mRNAâ€“AGO2 interaction, prevent degradation of translationally&#13;&#10;repressed messages and thus stop recycling of miRNPs pre-engaged in repression. Importance&#13;&#10;of other players in this process will be discussed."
