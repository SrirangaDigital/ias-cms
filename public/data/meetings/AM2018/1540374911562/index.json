        "title": "Fluorescent, AIEgen and cytotoxic behaviour of annulated polycyclic heteroaromatics",
        "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute an important class&#13;&#10;of molecules in material science due to their applications in electronic&#13;&#10;devices, semiconductors, solar cells, fluorescent probes and cancer&#13;&#10;cell imaging. Incorporation of heteroatoms (N, O or S) into PAHs can&#13;&#10;fine tune their chemical, physical and supramolecular properties. Transition-metal catalyzed&#13;&#10;aromatic C−H activation of arenes, hetero-arenes and alkynes has been a powerful synthetic&#13;&#10;strategy to access various polycylic heteroaromatics. The speaker will discuss Ruthenium(II)&#13;&#10;catalyzed oxidative C−H / O−H and C−H / S−H annulations that have been demonstrated by&#13;&#10;his team using different directing arenes, viz., 2-arylquinolinone, 2-arylbenzoxazinone, quinoline-4(1H)-thiones&#13;&#10;and quinoxaline with internal alkynes. He will also talk about Regiospecific&#13;&#10;annulations that have been observed for directing arenes via the assistance of weaker carbonyl&#13;&#10;or thio carbonyl groups in the presence of a stronger nitrogen-directing site. Some of the synthesized&#13;&#10;polycyclic hetero-aromatics are water soluble exhibiting fluorescence and aggregation&#13;&#10;induced emission (AIE). These AIE luminogens are highly cytotoxic against HeLa cell line and&#13;&#10;some have found application as fluorescent ‘light-up’ probes for cell imaging."
