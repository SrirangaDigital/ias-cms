        "title": "Genetics and biology of neuromuscular disorders: Unmet scientific need",
        "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders cause defect in peripheral nervous system and&#13;&#10;or muscles. Unfortunately for most diseases currently there are no treatments.&#13;&#10;Over the last 2–3 decades, it has become evident that most of&#13;&#10;these disorders have a genetic origin. Currently hundreds of genes have&#13;&#10;been identified and it is expected that more disease-associated genes will be found thanks to&#13;&#10;increasing whole genome sequence data. Not all patients of neuromuscular disorders inherit the&#13;&#10;mutations – increasing number of de novo mutations is being identified. Moreover, disease-associated&#13;&#10;genes have been found in both mitochondrial and nuclear genome and are known to&#13;&#10;participate in several different pathways. In most cases it is not clear how the mutations in the&#13;&#10;respective genes affect neural and or muscle functions. There is also very little information&#13;&#10;available about mechanisms of genotype–phenotype relationship in these diseases. The speaker&#13;&#10;will broadly cover these points in his talk."

He obtained a Master’s degree in&#13;&#10;Chemistry from IIT–Kanpur and PhD in Life Sciences from Jawaharlal Nehru University. He&#13;&#10;carried out post-doctoral work at National Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School,&#13;&#10;USA. After returning to India, he spent a few years at AIIMS, New Delhi, and Tata Research&#13;&#10;Development &#38; Design Centre, Pune, before joining Jawaharlal Nehru University as an&#13;&#10;Associate Professor. Initially he set up a lab to carry out research in immunology and infectious&#13;&#10;diseases, particularly for understanding immune response to pathogens at the molecular&#13;&#10;level. Later he developed a research program on amoebiasis, an intestinal disease highly&#13;&#10;endemic in India and one of the neglected tropical diseases. He had also set up one of the&#13;&#10;first teaching and research programs on bioinformatics and computational biology in India."
