        "title": "Cold fermions in artificial gauge fields",
        "abstract": "The possibility of employing cold atomic gases as emulators of condensed&#13;&#10;matter Hamiltonians has got boosted up by the birth and growth&#13;&#10;of the field of synthetic spin-orbit coupling. The speaker’s group studies&#13;&#10;interacting Fermi gas in 3D in presence of uniform synthetic non-Abelian&#13;&#10;gauge fields that induce a generalized Rashba-spin-orbit coupling&#13;&#10;(RSOC). In presence of a class of RSOC, however small, a two-particle bound state exists even for&#13;&#10;an arbitrarily small attraction. The fermion system can evolve to a Bose–Einstein condensate of&#13;&#10;a novel boson called the rashbon, whose properties are determined solely by RSOC and not by&#13;&#10;the interaction between the fermions or the fermion density. Via a study of collective excitations&#13;&#10;of the superfluid state, the rashbon–rashbon interaction has been shown to be independent of&#13;&#10;the constituent fermion–fermion interaction. By constructing a fluctuation theory, the speaker&#13;&#10;demonstrates that RSOC enhances the transition temperature of a weak Fermi superfluid to the&#13;&#10;order of Fermi temperature."
