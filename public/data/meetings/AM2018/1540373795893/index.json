        "abstract": "The speaker and her group have carried out pollen and non-pollen palynomorph&#13;&#10;analyses of 16 summer and winter dung samples of two endangered&#13;&#10;deer species, Sangai (Rucervus eldii eldii Mâ€™clelland) and Hog deer&#13;&#10;(Axis porcinus Zimmermann) from Keibul Lamjao National Park of Manipur, northeast India, in&#13;&#10;order to examine the dietary preferences of these species in relation to the vegetation and ecology&#13;&#10;of the region. In her talk, the speaker will discuss the significance of her findings which will&#13;&#10;be helpful to document and understand seasonal difference in dietary preferences and ecology&#13;&#10;of the two deer species along with the other associated herbivores in the region. The palynodata&#13;&#10;is also useful in tracing the relationship between modern pollen and vegetation, which is challenging&#13;&#10;to accomplish systematically due to seasonal flooding of the region.

Her research interests include Quaternary vegetation&#13;&#10;and climate change through pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, examining pollen&#13;&#10;micro-morphometry of living plants, coprolite studies and melissopalynology. She received&#13;&#10;three gold medals including Birbal Sahni Memorial Gold Medal during her MSc (Botany),&#13;&#10;Lucknow University, in 2007. She received her PhD in 2011 from the Department of Botany,&#13;&#10;Lucknow University. She is also the recipient of the Dr B.S. Venkatachala Memorial Medal&#13;&#10;(2012) and the Dr Chunni Lal Khatiyal Medal (2016) for outstanding research work. She is&#13;&#10;an Associate (2017) of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru. She has 32 research papers&#13;&#10;and has trained five MSc students including one summer research fellow through Indian&#13;&#10;Academy of Sciences (SRF-P) and is currently running a SERB-fast track young scientist&#13;&#10;project."
