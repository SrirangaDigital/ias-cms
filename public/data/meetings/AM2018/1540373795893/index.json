        "biodata": "Swati Tripathi is currently working as a Scientist-C in the Quaternary Laboratory of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow. Her research interests include Quaternary vegetation and climate change through pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, examining pollen micro-morphometry of living plants, coprolite studies and melissopalynology. She received three gold medals including Birbal Sahni Memorial Gold Medal during her MSc (Botany), Lucknow University, in 2007. She received her PhD in 2011 from the Department of Botany, Lucknow University. She is also the recipient of the Dr B.S. Venkatachala Memorial Medal (2012) and the Dr Chunni Lal Khatiyal Medal (2016) for outstanding research work. She is an Associate (2017) of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru. She has 32 research papers and has trained five MSc students including one summer research fellow through Indian Academy of Sciences (SRF-P) and is currently running a SERB-fast track young scientist project."

        "abstract": "The speaker and her group have carried out pollen and non-pollen palynomorph analyses of 16 summer and winter dung samples of two endangered deer species, Sangai (<i>Rucervus eldii eldii</i> Mâ€™clelland) and Hog deer <i>(Axis porcinus </i>Zimmermann) from Keibul Lamjao National Park of Manipur, northeast India, in order to examine the dietary preferences of these species in relation to the vegetation and ecology of the region. In her talk, the speaker will discuss the significance of her findings which will be helpful to document and understand seasonal difference in dietary preferences and ecology of the two deer species along with the other associated herbivores in the region. The palynodata is also useful in tracing the relationship between modern pollen and vegetation, which is challenging to accomplish systematically due to seasonal flooding of the region."
