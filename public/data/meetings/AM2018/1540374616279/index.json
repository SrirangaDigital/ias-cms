        "title": "Host-microbial associations in a changing world",
        "abstract": "Eukaryotic hosts are often associated with microbes that enhance their&#13;&#10;fitness. Although faithful transmission of the microbes across generations&#13;&#10;is important to establish and maintain the relationship, in some&#13;&#10;cases the microbes are environmentally acquired. Thus, when hosts&#13;&#10;disperse to new habitats or switch to a new diet, they may not have access&#13;&#10;to the appropriate microbes, leading to reduced fitness. In such cases, can the host establish new&#13;&#10;microbial partnerships? Are such partnerships specific, and how long does the established process&#13;&#10;require? More generally, how are microbial communities assembled, and (how) does host&#13;&#10;association influence this process? In this talk, the speaker will discuss her efforts to address&#13;&#10;these questions in different insects, both in the laboratory and in the field."

        "biodata": "Deepa Agashe received her Bachelorâ€™s degree in Microbiology from Garware College,&#13;&#10;University of Pune, in 2003. Subsequently, she obtained her PhD from the University of&#13;&#10;Texas at Austin, in 2009. For her thesis, she conducted laboratory experiments with beetles&#13;&#10;to test the impact of genetic diversity on population dynamics and niche use. For her postdoctoral&#13;&#10;work, she went to Harvard University, Boston, where she experimentally tested the&#13;&#10;impact of synonymous mutations in bacterial genes. She returned to India in 2012 and established&#13;&#10;a research group at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bengaluru. Her&#13;&#10;current work focuses on understanding evolutionary and ecological process using bacterial&#13;&#10;and insect systems."
