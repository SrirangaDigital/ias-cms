        "title": "Hardware implementation of neural network algorithms, based on machine learning and neuroscience models, using spintronic devices as non-volatile memory elements",
        "abstract": "Neural Network algorithms are widely used by the machine learning and&#13;&#10;data sciences community to solve various classification, recognition and&#13;&#10;prediction tasks. These algorithms, if implemented on hardware instead&#13;&#10;of software, can provide further advantages owing to the parallel architecture and the principle&#13;&#10;of memory embedded computing inherent in these algorithms. Spintronic devices owing to their&#13;&#10;non-volatility can make excellent memory elements for the hardware implementation of Neural&#13;&#10;Networks. The speaker will discuss a few such spintronic implementations of Neural Network,&#13;&#10;which he and his team have carried out through simulations at IIT Delhi. One such implementation&#13;&#10;follows a Neural Network algorithm that is largely inspired by the functioning of the&#13;&#10;brain – Spiking Neural Network, enabled with Spike Time Dependent Plasticity. If implemented&#13;&#10;in spintronic hardware it can not only solve several problems of relevance to the machine learning&#13;&#10;community but also may help improve our understanding of the functioning of the brain in&#13;&#10;future. "
