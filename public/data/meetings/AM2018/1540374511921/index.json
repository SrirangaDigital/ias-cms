        "title": "GM crops in the Indian context: Looking back, looking forward",
        "abstract": "The discovery of plant transformation in the early 1980s enabled enormous&#13;&#10;advances to take place over the last three decades in our understanding&#13;&#10;of plant biology at the molecular level. It has also led to major&#13;&#10;application in agricultural biotechnology through development of genetically&#13;&#10;modified (GM) crops carrying genes from other species (transgenics)&#13;&#10;that target agricultural issues such as pests and weeds. Several of these GM crops have been&#13;&#10;widely deployed and enjoyed a high degree of commercial success, but have also been associated&#13;&#10;with medium to long term ecological, environmental, and stakeholder costs which have been&#13;&#10;high in several cases. The views on GM technology cover a wide spectrum from GM being considered&#13;&#10;essential for increasing agricultural productivity to strong opposition and questioning&#13;&#10;of GM approaches on being able to deliver on safe and sustainable agriculture that takes small&#13;&#10;farmerâ€™s interests into account. What is becoming increasingly apparent is that the consequences&#13;&#10;of GM crops are determined not just by the technology itself but the context and modalities of&#13;&#10;its deployment, including socioeconomic factors and policy environments. GM technologies are&#13;&#10;rapidly evolving and it is now necessary to distinguish between GM and transgenics. The presentation&#13;&#10;will cover background information on GM crop technology, a discussion of GM crop usage&#13;&#10;in the Indian context, and possible future scenarios. "

        "biodata": "At the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, Imran Siddiqi is a plant&#13;&#10;geneticist whose research has been on understanding the mechanisms by which genetic information&#13;&#10;is transmitted from parent to progeny in plants at the time of meiosis and germ cell&#13;&#10;formation. His work has provided fundamental insights into how clonal seed formation can&#13;&#10;be achieved, avoiding the variation that normally occurs as a result of the normal process of&#13;&#10;sexual reproduction. His research has important implications for agriculture as being able&#13;&#10;to engineer clonal seed formation in crop plants, which can revolutionize plant breeding&#13;&#10;and agriculture particularly in developing countries. He is a recipient of the Infosys Prize&#13;&#10;in Life Sciences in 2011, and the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Indian Institute of&#13;&#10;Technology, Bombay, 2012. He is a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2008) and the&#13;&#10;Indian National Science Academy. He has served in an advisory capacity for a number of research&#13;&#10;organizations and is a member of the editorial boards of several leading international&#13;&#10;journals in plant sciences."
