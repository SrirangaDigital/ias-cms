        "title": "The sciences of the artificial: Promise and reality",
        "abstract": "The natural sciences describe objects in nature, while the sciences of&#13;&#10;the artificial describe artifacts that come from human intervention in&#13;&#10;the natural world. This perspective helped the Nobel laureate Herbert&#13;&#10;Simon pioneer the integration of cognitive, mathematical and computational&#13;&#10;methods to study artificial complexity and confirm the thesis&#13;&#10;that a physical symbol system and the computer as an artifact have the necessary means for&#13;&#10;intelligent action. Ideas of machine intelligence go back to the early postwar period with Alan&#13;&#10;Turing’s famous formulation of the imitation game which became known as the Turing test.&#13;&#10;Artificial and Augmented Intelligence joined hands with the decision sciences and became an&#13;&#10;integral part of the data analytics toolbox. Today Artificial Intelligence or AI is synonymous with&#13;&#10;‘deep learning’. For AI, the departure from the computer as an artifact began in the 90s with the&#13;&#10;advent of the cloud and great advances in training hardware and software for artificial neural&#13;&#10;networks. Geoffrey Hinton in Toronto has built this magnificent edifice of deep learning, which&#13;&#10;has become all pervasive."
