        "title": "Buddhism and science",
        "abstract": "Buddhism and science have striking similarities, particularly with&#13;&#10;respect to their approach to search deeper reality. Buddhism, especially&#13;&#10;in the tradition of ancient Nalanda, has a rich system of wide range of&#13;&#10;analytical philosophy, which has a strong practice of logic and epistemology&#13;&#10;as instruments for investigation and analysis. Indian philosophy&#13;&#10;in general and Buddhism in particular, explored the reality of the external world, which is&#13;&#10;inextricably associated with the inner world, the system of mind. There have been occasional&#13;&#10;dialogues between science and Buddhism in the past. However, since over three decades, interaction&#13;&#10;between Buddhism and Science has been going on intensively on regular basis with the&#13;&#10;initiatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Leading scientists in the fields of physics, neuroscience,&#13;&#10;astronomy, psychology, cognitive science and clinical research have participated and many&#13;&#10;researches have shown ground breaking results. Some of the major findings in the field of neuroscience&#13;&#10;exploring into the system of the mind and emotions have changed the principles of&#13;&#10;science. Researches on emotions have become an area of great interest in the domain of science&#13;&#10;and based on these findings, practices such as Mindfulness, Regulation of Emotions and Social&#13;&#10;Emotional Learnings are being practiced widely in schools, public domain and clinical services"
