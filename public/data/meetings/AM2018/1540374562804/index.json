        "title": "Electrochemical energy storage via batteries: Prospects and limitations",
        "abstract": "Among the various possible alternatives for energy storage, the electrochemical&#13;&#10;method provides great opportunities for efficient energy&#13;&#10;storage and sustainable development. It is now widely recognized that&#13;&#10;electrochemical energy storage systems such as batteries have tremendous&#13;&#10;potential in large scale applications such as electric mobility, electric power grids and also&#13;&#10;for integration with renewables, e.g., solar and wind. The extent of energy that can be stored&#13;&#10;in a battery is largely driven by the underlying redox chemical reaction. Since the evolution of&#13;&#10;batteries, many unique redox mechanisms have been demonstrated which have led to devices&#13;&#10;ranging from mere laboratory demonstrations to successful mass scale industrial production.&#13;&#10;Despite the deep emphasis on applications, battery (electro)chemistry poses formidable basic&#13;&#10;research challenges in various fields of chemistry as well as allied areas of science. The talk will&#13;&#10;cover various scientific challenges in the context of energy storage mechanisms, materials and&#13;&#10;future prospects and limitations of rechargeable batteries."
