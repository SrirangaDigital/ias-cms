        "title": "From serendipity to designing molecular gels for drug delivery",
        "abstract": "In early 2000, the speaker and his team’s efforts to understand crystal&#13;&#10;engineering prospects in organic salts led to the serendipitous discovery&#13;&#10;of molecular gelators derived from a simple organic salts. Since then,&#13;&#10;they have been seriously engaged in studying organic salts systematically&#13;&#10;by invoking supramolecular synthons in the context of crystal&#13;&#10;engineering. Such efforts provided better insights into the mechanism of gelation and consequently&#13;&#10;allowed them to design gelators for various applications. In this presentation, gel inducing&#13;&#10;supramolecular synthons developed by their group and its implication in designing gels for&#13;&#10;bio-medical applications such as drug delivery in a self-delivery fashion will be discussed with&#13;&#10;selected examples."

He received his PhD from the Indian Institute of Science,&#13;&#10;Bengaluru in 1994. After postdoctoral stints in Tel-Aviv (Israel), UNAM (Mexico), and&#13;&#10;Wayne State University (USA), he joined CSMCRI, Bhavnagar, India, in 1998 as a Scientist&#13;&#10;before moving to IACS in 2007. His research interests include crystal engineering, supramolecular&#13;&#10;gels, topical gels for drug delivery and coordination polymers/complexes based materials.&#13;&#10;He is the recipent of CRSI Bronze Medal in Chemistry, 2012 and JSPS Fellowship (Jan,&#13;&#10;2004–Nov., 2004) by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. He is also the co-editor,&#13;&#10;Acta Crystallographica E, and is a life member of Indian Crystallographic Association and&#13;&#10;Chemical Research Society of India. He was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of&#13;&#10;Sciences in 2018. "
