        "chairperson": "A K Ganguli, IIT Delhi",
        "title": "Biomaterialomics: Data-driven accelerated pathways for next generation biomaterials",
        "abstract": "Conventional approaches in biomaterials science or bioengineering&#13;&#10;involve the intuitive way of tailoring process variables that often incur&#13;&#10;long development cycles and high costs. Accelerated development of&#13;&#10;patient-customized implantable biomaterials or biomedical devices to&#13;&#10;achieve the efficient bedside–bench–bedside translation cycle is the need of the hour. Building&#13;&#10;on the concepts of the Materials Genome Initiative, the speaker will define a new term, ‘Biomaterialomics’,&#13;&#10;that relies on a data-driven integrated understanding of biocompatibility and&#13;&#10;elements of biomaterials development, leveraging both conventional and advanced manufacturing.&#13;&#10;Newer computational approaches to establish process-structure-property (PSP) linkages,&#13;&#10;relatively well explored for structural materials, can play significant role in the development and&#13;&#10;deployment of new generation biomaterials. Studies published by the speaker’s research group&#13;&#10;will be used as case studies to illustrate the formulation of PSP frameworks. The Biomaterialomics&#13;&#10;approach will significantly aid in the development of a new generation of bioimplants, whose&#13;&#10;predictive clinical performance could be closely tracked by ‘digital twins’. Futuristic challenges&#13;&#10;of the field will also be discussed."
