        "title": "Low-dimensional spin systems and quantum magnetism",
        "abstract": "Low dimensional magnetic systems have been of great interest due to&#13;&#10;their novel, unconventional, and complex electronic and magnetic properties.&#13;&#10;Spin systems with reduced space dimension can show magnetic&#13;&#10;frustrations. Frustrated quantum magnetic systems provide a rich playground&#13;&#10;for interplay of competing exchange interactions and quantum&#13;&#10;fluctuations, and are at the forefront to explore unconventional phases of condensed matter. It&#13;&#10;is important to understand the physics of such spin systems. Spin lattices, such as triangular,&#13;&#10;square, Kagome, honeycomb and spin-trimer are of special importance. Neutron scattering is&#13;&#10;known to be an excellent microscopic probe to investigate magnetic states. The speaker and&#13;&#10;his group have revealed nature of magnetic ground states of a large variety of spin systems&#13;&#10;with reduced dimensions involving quantum fluctuations. In his talk, the speaker will present&#13;&#10;the recent experimental results of neutron scattering elucidating the microscopic nature&#13;&#10;of magnetic correlations in some of these naturally occurring low dimensional spin systems.&#13;&#10;The experimental results will be compared with the available theoretical results revealing the&#13;&#10;physics of such novel spin systems with regard to physical properties in reduced dimensions&#13;&#10;involving quantum fluctuations."
