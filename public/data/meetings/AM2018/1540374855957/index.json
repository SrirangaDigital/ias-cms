        "title": "Early life origins of diabetes in Indians",
        "abstract": "The dogma of diabetes describes a genetic susceptibility and precipitation&#13;&#10;by obesogenic factors (diet, inactivity, stress etc). The genetic&#13;&#10;factors are non-modifiable, therefore, the diabetes prevention trials of&#13;&#10;today concentrate on treatment of precipitating factors (diet, exercise&#13;&#10;and stress). The interventions are usually done in post-reproductive&#13;&#10;adults, and therefore, do not help the next generation. Both fetal under- and over-nutrition has&#13;&#10;been found to increase susceptibility of the fetus to future disease; this process is now called&#13;&#10;‘fetal programming’. A wide range of environmental factors operating in pregnancy have the&#13;&#10;potential for fetal programming. India has a unique position, in that it is the world’s capital of&#13;&#10;early life undernutrition, as well as being one of the world capitals of diabetes. Research has&#13;&#10;demonstrated a substantial role for fetal programming by maternal undernutrition, as well as&#13;&#10;diabetes, in the aetiology of diabetes. A part of this susceptibility operates through influences on&#13;&#10;body composition and both micronutrient deficiencies and macronutrient excess increase the&#13;&#10;risk. Postnatal factors that promote a catch-up growth in small babies seem to exaggerate the&#13;&#10;risk. Epigenetic factors also seem to be playing an important role, which suggests that the susceptibility&#13;&#10;to non-communicable disease could be modified. Trials are in progress to influence&#13;&#10;fetal programming by improving the health of the adolescents."

He investigates the high susceptibility of Indians to diabetes&#13;&#10;and related disorders. He is known for his description of the ‘thin-fat’ Indian (high body fat&#13;&#10;percent at low BMI) and its intrauterine programming by maternal nutritional and metabolic&#13;&#10;factors.&#13;&#10;He is an Honorary Visiting Fellow, MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, Southampton,&#13;&#10;UK, visiting Professor at University of Exeter UK, and of the Danish Diabetes Academy,&#13;&#10;and adjunct Professor IISER, Pune. He received Helmut Mehnert Award of International&#13;&#10;Diabetes Federation (2009), David Barker Medal of International DOHaD Society (2011),&#13;&#10;and Outstanding Investigator Award of World-India Diabetes Foundation.
