        "title": "Remote sensing and GIS application for geohazard studies",
        "abstract": "Usage of spatial technology such as remote sensing and GIS has created immense scope for monitoring and proper mitigation of hazards. These spatial tools have played a vital role in identification and mapping of geo-hazard regions. Geo-hazards such as landslides are triggered by various factors such as anthropogenic activities, rainfall, geology, etc. Mitiga-tion, therefore, becomes crucial especially in hilly terrains which are unstable and prone to slope failures. Earthquakes pose a serious threat owing to its unpredictable and destructive nature. The entire Northeast India is located in a high hazard risk zone owing to its active tectonic, geology and topographic setting, torrential rainfall besides expansion of human habitat which has further aggravated the already fragile environment. The region falls un-der seismic zone V, which is highly vulnerable to seismic activity. Use of remote sensing satellite imagery has helped in the identification and mapping of hazards. The susceptible area has been demarcated and assigned certain weights to create hazard zonation map. The zonation map has been ranked based on its susceptibility which helps in proper remedial and mitigation process. "
