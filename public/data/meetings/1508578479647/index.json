        "title": "Percival Spear: Historian and Indophile",
        "abstract": "Indian history has, over the years, drawn the attention of the discerning readers for a variety of reasons; its span in time, geographical coverage, its people and institutions, the polities large and small, and in more recent times, Indian nationalism. Among the many fine histo-rians who have contributed to the understanding of India’s past, that of Percival Spear was enormous. As a teacher, he impacted many of his students and scholars. Many more of his readers have appreciated his presentation of the histories he wrote, in a style that was his own. His coverage of Indian history spanned many centuries and comes up to more recent times. Histories he wrote were broad, seminal, fitting into a distinctive school of histori-ography and were fine works in literature. In more recent times, his studies have almost been set aside for more pointed and detailed research. Every age has its historians. Such are the histories Percival Spear worked on, that they require attention and appreciation for this great admirer of India, its people and its past."
