        "biodata": "Kaustuv Sanyal obtained PhD from Bose Institute and postdoctoral training at the University of California, Santa Barbara on yeast molecular genetics. He joined JNCASR, Bengaluru in late 2005 as assistant professor and promoted to the rank of professor in Molecular Biology and Genetics Unit. Since his graduate studies, the major focus of his research is to under-stand the mechanism of chromosome segregation using various yeasts, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic, as model systems. He has been awarded the prestigious Tata Innovation Fellowship and National Bioscience Award by the Department of Biotechnology (India). He is a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2017), NASI, and a member of the Faculty of 1000 (F1000Prime), UK. Currently, he leads a large group of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and actively collaborates with many research groups across the world."
