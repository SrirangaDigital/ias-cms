        "title": "Selectivity engineering in sustainable production of chemicals, fuels and energy from biomass and carbon dioxide",
        "abstract": "Biomass conversion technologies consist of sugar platform (biochemical/fermentation), extraction and chemical conversion (syngas) and it provides challenging opportunities. Biorefineries must adopt the Green Chemistry principles. The development of lignocellulose treatments will be key to unlocking a major sugar source for biological conversion into industrial products. Catalysis is the most pivotal principle of Green Chemistry, which inherently aims at reduction of waste, both, of material and energy. Cascade engineered multistep reactions along with complex multifunctional catalyst yields required process intensification at the molecular level. The multifunctional catalysts required for such reactions possess multi-functionality such as acid, base and metal sites. Reactions occur on these multiple sites in a concerted or sequential manner. New opportunities for the conversion of glycerol, co-product of biodiesel, into value-added chemicals have emerged, in recent years, as a result of glycerolâ€™s unique structure, properties, bioavailability, and renewability. The principles of selectivity engineering and cascade engineering in the valorisation of biomass and bio-based products will be the central theme of this lecture."
